    <h1>I am currently a Senior at the University of Oklahoma studying Supply Chain Management and MIS. The past few summers I interned at Justice Benefits Inc. where I learned excel skills and a little bit about data analysis. I am currently looking for a Summer 2023 Internship, which will provide me with an opportunity to learn about the industry and allow me to show my determination to succeed.</h1>
